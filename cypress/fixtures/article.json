    "body": "One cryptocurrency that has gained a huge following since its launch in 2015 is ethereum (known as ETH). It has a total value of around £168bn, making it the second-largest cryptocurrency. Ethereum isn’t just a currency either because it is used in smart contracts, which allow transactions to be carried out when certain conditions have been met. Payments giant Visa has said it will start using ethereum as a way of recording cryptocurrency transactions. The price of ethereum has increased from £149 to £2,446 over the past year. \n \n We talk more about ethereum here: Bitcoin alternatives: the most important other cryptocurrencies. The new cryptocurrencies on the block are SafeMoon and Dogecoin. Bear in mind that neither of these are widely used and because they are so new, the risks could be higher. Dogecoin is currently trading at about 35p. SafeMoon is another new cryptocurrency that aims to cut out the banks with the use of financial tokens (we explain more later on in this article).",
